# Training Modules App

## Overview
A simple Android app in Kotlin that displays a list of training modules, allows marking them as completed or pending, and persists the status using `SharedPreferences`. The app uses XML layouts and RecyclerView.

---

## Features
- Home screen shows a vertical list of modules with title, short description, and status.
- Detail screen shows full title and description with a button to toggle completed/pending.
- Three filter buttons on Home screen: All, Completed, Pending.
- Persistent status using SharedPreferences.
- App Bar on both screens with proper navigation.

---

## Technical Requirements
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Separation of concerns:** Simple UI and data logic separation (can be upgraded to MVVM).
- **Jetpack Components:** SharedPreferences used for persistence; can integrate ViewModel or LiveData for state management.
- **Target SDK:** Recent Android version (API 33+ recommended)
- **UI:** XML layouts, RecyclerView

---

## Architecture
Currently implemented as a simple **UI + data separation**:

- **Data:** `TrainingModule` data class and SharedPreferences for persistence.
- **UI:** `HomeActivity` and `DetailActivity` handle UI and user interactions.
- **Adapter:** `ModuleAdapter` binds data to RecyclerView.
- **Filter logic:** Managed in HomeActivity.

**Note:** Not full MVVM, but separation allows easy refactor.

## Installation and Run Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
3. Ensure the **SDK version** is up to date.
4. Build and run on an emulator or device.
5. Interact with the modules list and detail screen; status changes persist.

---

## Why this approach
- Chose **SharedPreferences** for persistence due to simplicity and the small dataset.
- Used **RecyclerView + Adapter** for modular UI.
- Filter buttons allow dynamic updates without heavy architecture.

---

## Improvements with more time
If we had **one more day**, we would:
- Implement **MVVM** fully using **ViewModel + LiveData/StateFlow** for better state management.
- Replace SharedPreferences with **Room** for more structured persistence.
- Make filters **highlight the selected button** for better UX.
- Add **animations for completed/pending** state change.
- Add **unit and UI tests** for reliability.
- Support **dynamic data loading** instead of hardcoded modules.
